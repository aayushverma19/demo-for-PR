# Steps to Create a Pull Request (PR)

**Log in to your GitHub**

 * Go to Repositories and click New.

 * Enter the name for your repository, choose public or private, and add a description if you want.

* Click Create Repository to set it up.


## **2. Clone the repository to your local system**

```
git clone <your-repo-link>
```
Downloads the repository from GitHub to your local machine so you can work on it.

## **3. Change directory to your project directory**

```
cd <project_name>
```

Navigates to the folder where your project is stored locally.

## **4. Create a new branch and switch to the same branch**

```
git checkout -b <new_branch>            ( Create and switch to the new branch at same time )
```
or
```
git branch <new_branch>             ( Creates new branch )
git checkout <new_branch>           ( Switch to new branch )
```
Creates a new branch to isolate your changes from the main codebase.

## **5. Get all branches in your repository**

```
git branch
```
Lists all branches in the repository to see which branch youâ€™re currently on.

## **6. Make changes in the project**

```
echo "Changes made!!" >> file.txt
```
Adds or modifies files in your project to implement the desired changes.

## **7. Check the status**

```
git status
```
Shows the current state of your working directory (staged, unstaged, and untracked files).

## **8. Stage your changes**

```
git add <file name>
```
Adds your changes to the staging area, preparing them for a commit.

## **9. Commit the changes with a message**

```
git commit -m "enter the message"
```
 Saves your changes to the local repository with a descriptive message.

## **10. Push your code to GitHub**

```
git push --set-upstream origin <new_branch>  #links your (new_branch) to the remote branch (origin/new_branch) 
                                             #git push upload changes to remote repository
```
Uploads your local branch and changes to the remote repository on GitHub.

# Rules and Best Practices for Pull Requests


1. **Follow the Contribution Guidelines**:
   - Many repositories have a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file. Make sure to read and follow the guidelines provided there.

2. **Write Clear Commit Messages**:
   - Commit messages should be clear and descriptive. They should explain what the commit does and why.

3. **Keep PRs Small and Focused**:
   - Try to keep your pull requests focused on a single issue or feature. This makes it easier for reviewers to understand and review your changes.

4. **Test Your Changes**:
   - Make sure your changes work as expected and do not introduce new bugs. Run any existing tests and add new tests if necessary.

5. **Update Documentation**:
   - If your changes require updates to the documentation, make sure to include those updates in your PR.

6. **Respond to Feedback**:
   - Be open to feedback from reviewers. Make the necessary changes and push them to the same branch. The PR will automatically update.

7. **Squash Commits (if necessary)**:
   - If you have multiple commits, consider squashing them into a single commit to keep the history clean. This can be done using interactive rebase:
   ```bash
   git rebase -i HEAD~n
   ```
   Where `n` is the number of commits you want to squash.
